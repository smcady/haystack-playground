IANA-managed Reserved Domains
Certain domains are set aside, and nominally registered to “IANA”, for specific
		policy or technical purposes.
Example domains
As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761,
	a number of domains such as example.com and example.org
	are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative
	examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are 
	not available for registration or transfer.
Test IDN top-level domains
These domains were temporarily delegated by IANA for the IDN Evaluation being conducted by ICANN.

Policy-reserved domains
We act as both the registrant and registrar for a select number of domains
		which have been reserved under policy grounds. These exclusions are
		typically indicated in either technical standards (RFC documents),
		or contractual limitations.
Domains which are described as registered to IANA or ICANN on policy
		grounds are not available for registration or transfer, with the exception
		of country-name.info domains. These domains are available for release
		by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee Secretariat.
Other Special-Use Domains
There is additionally a Special-Use Domain Names registry documenting special-use domains designated by technical standards. For further information, see Special-Use Domain Names (RFC 6761).
